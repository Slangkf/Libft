# Description

*This section presents the project, its goals and a brief overview :*

In this very first project of the 42 curriculum, I had to create my own personal library by reimplementing some functions from the standard C library (libc).

# Instructions

*This section contains information about compilation, installation, and/or execution:*

To build the library, go to the root of the project and compile it using the `make` command.

Each function includes its own `main()` function to allow individual testing.

The libft is now ready to be used.
